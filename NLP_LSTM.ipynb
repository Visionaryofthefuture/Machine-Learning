To illustrate that point, author Samantha Schmidt used anecdotal evidence of a child who said she had a scary dream involving the GOP nominee. \\nSchmidt wrote: \\nBilal Elcharfa was pouring cereal for his children before school this month when his 7-year-old daughter, Maaria, walked into the kitchen, calling for him. \\n\\u201cBaba, I had a scary dream,\\u201d she said, hugging him tight. \\u201cAbout Donald Trump .\\u201d \\nIt was the morning after the second presidential debate, which the Elcharfa family\\u2019s two youngest daughters watched in the basement of their Staten Island home with their parents. In the middle of the night, Maaria went to her parents\\u2019 room twice, unable to sleep, and walked to the living room and checked her family\\u2019s security camera. \\nThat morning, Mr. Elcharfa, 52, asked his daughter what she saw in the nightmare. \\n\\u201cHe was so mean to us,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe had a scary face, like a zombie or something.\\u201d In the dream, Maaria later said, Mr. Trump came to the home of every Muslim family in the country and put each one in jail. \\n\\u201cMany Muslim parents fear that the tensions could push their children away from the faith entirely. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t know how to handle it sometimes,\\u201d Elcharfa is further quoted. \\u201cMaybe someday they won\\u2019t believe in anything,\\u201d Schmidt added. \\nBut how is this Trump\\u2019s fault? Isn\\u2019t it the parents\\u2019 job to raise their children? \\nA post at the American Thinker observed: \\nHere we have an article blaming Donald Trump for terrorizing children for something he has never said or even intimated. He doesn\\u2019t want to put all Muslims in jail; he just wants to reduce immigration from countries that are un-vettable in the Middle East. One does not translate into the other. \\nBut that assumes one deals in facts, logic, and reason. As we\\u2019ve seen this election season, the so-called \\u201cmainstream media,\\u201d known here as the Democrat-media complex, have decided to toss facts, logic and reason out the window in a concerted effort to elect Democrat Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most evil person ever nominated to the White House by a major party, by any means necessary \\u2014 even using propaganda the likes of which would make Josef Goebbels smile. \\nThere\\u2019s no question \\u2014 if Democrats nominated Satan, the media would worship him and call you a bigot for opposing him. \\nRelated Articles\",\n          \"By Brig Asif H. Raja on November 1, 2016 \\nAsif Haroon Raja \\nThe ISI had developed its long arm capability during the tenures of Gen Akhtar Abdur Rehman, Lt Gen Hamid Gul (VT editor) and Lt Gen Javed Nasir as DG ISI. It was owing to this capability of hitting the chosen target outside the frontiers of Pakistan that the ISI earned the reputation of a dreaded outfit and the best in Asia. The long arm began to shrivel when Benazir Bhutto was PM from 1988 to 1990 and Gen Waheed Kakar was COAS and Lt Gen Javed Ashraf Qazi had replaced Gen Javed Nasir. This change in posture was a result of pressure of the US and the West, pressing Pakistan to refrain from meddling in Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) and in India, or else it will be declared a terrorist state. Pressure was mounted at the behest of India which had become strategic partner of USA and Israel in 1991/1992 and darling of the West. \\nAfter the occupation of Afghanistan by 1, 50,000 Soviet forces in December 1979, Pakistan under Gen Ziaul Haq had decided to provide refuge to about 5 million Afghan refugees and to support the Afghan Mujahideen in their resistance. The US came forward with a package of $ 3.5 billion in June 1981 after making a measured assessment that Pakistan had the will and capability to fight the proxy war. The offer was accepted only when it was conveyed that the ISI will coordinate and conduct the entire war without the aid of CIA and that the US and others would restrict their support to provision of funds and weapons/equipment only. As a Frontline State, Pakistan suffered a great deal throughout the Afghan war at the hands of KGB-KHAD-RAW-AlZulfiqar nexus and Afghan armed forces, but achieved the miracle by defeating and pushing out Soviet forces in February 1989. After achieving its objective without employing a single soldier, the US abandoned Pakistan as well as the Mujahideen who had sacrificed 1.5 million people and had helped the US in becoming a sole super power. \\nOnce Pakistan fell from the grace of USA and it was put under sanctions on account of its covert nuclear program suspected to be geared towards making an Islamic bomb, it came under the shadow of black star. Pakistan\\u2019s nuclear program became an eyesore for India, Israel and USA. It faced the whole brunt of fallout effects of ten-year Afghan war that had been fully supported by the US led free world. USSR that had shrunk to Russian Federation was highly bitter, while India was perpetually hostile. Iran was not so friendly owing to its reservations over the developments in Afghanistan. Explosive situation in Afghanistan due to civil war and power tussle among the seven Mujahideen groups impacted the security of Pakistan. \\nStart of armed insurgency in IOK in late 1989 and India pumping in over 700,000 troops into the Valley had its effects on Pakistan\\u2019s security dynamics. In 1990/91, both sides had come close to war. Internally, the society had become militarized due to the Afghan war and sectarianism fomented by Iran and Saudi Arabia had created serious law and order situation in Punjab. PPP and PML-N acrimoniously tussled with each other for power because of which no govt could complete its mandatory 5 years tenure. \\nFragmentation of USSR and demise of communism on account of its military defeat in Afghanistan and increase of influence of Pakistan and India decreasing its influence in Afghanistan had vexed India. It feared that Pakistan may exploit the situation in IOK and liberate it with the help of over 60 Jihadi groups and take its revenge of the humiliation it had suffered in East Pakistan in 1971. It dreaded that Pakistan may replicate its model of supporting the Mukti Bahini. Sensing the gravity of the situation, India started propagating that Pakistan is behind the insurgency in IOK and that the ISI is funding, training and launching terrorists from Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK). It urged the UN and world powers to rein in Pakistan and restrain ISI from conducting cross LoC terrorism. \\nThe US, both Republicans and Democrats, had been constantly wooing India to join its camp since early 1950s, but India preferred the Soviet camp, although it professed to be non-aligned. It was elated when India feeling orphaned after the collapse of USSR fell like a ripe apple into the waiting arms of USA and both became bedfellows in 1991. Once its newfound love sought help from her paramour, the latter stood behind her and sternly cautioned Pakistan to lay its hands off IOK. Change in circumstances compelled Pakistan to restrict its support to the Kashmiris in distress to moral, political and diplomatic levels only. The Kashmir oriented Jihadi groups based in AJK and in Southern Punjab however continued to extend support to the Kashmiris seeking right of self-determination as provided for in the UN resolutions. Indian security forces equipped with draconian laws and license to kill without any fear of accountability or censure by the UN and world powers carried out inhuman torture, employed massive force, and used rape as a weapon to break the will of the freedom fighters. The UN and international community turned a deaf ear to the cries of Kashmiris. \\nDespite the fact that IOK had become the most militarized region of the world (one soldier for 17 civilians), and Kashmiris had suffered over 100,000 fatalities, 10,000 rapes, detention of thousands in secret dens and destruction of their property, the freedom fighters kept the torch of liberty aglow. The heroics of Kashmiris against heavy odds had a telling effect on the morale of Indian Army and paramilitary forces in IOK. Soldiers suffered from demoralization and homesickness; cases of suicides, desertions, killing of seniors and comrades by soldiers, and indiscipline jumped up at an alarming rate. Officers and men dreaded posting to Kashmir, while rate of compassionate cases wanting posting out from Kashmir shot up. A stage came when recruitment in Army dropped to rock bottom levels. The then Indian Army chief had to appear on the TV and run an ad campaign to appeal to the youth to join the Army on better pay scale and perks. Kashmir had become a perforated wound for India and economic cost was becoming unbearable. It was becoming difficult for India to hide its massive human rights violations and barbarities of Indian security forces. \\nHere I may add that the Indian Army had suffered humiliation at Dras-Kargil in 1999 at the hands of handful of Mujahideen and irregulars of Northern Light Infantry. It was eventually bailed out by the US led G-8 by exerting immense pressure on Pakistan to immediately vacate the captured territories. The Indian armed forces went through another embarrassment in 2002 when it had to sheepishly withdraw from its western border after a ten-month standoff during which it had constantly huffed and puffed but couldn\\u2019t pick up courage to cross the border. Aggressive response of Pak armed forces had taken the steam out of their chauvinism. \\nUnfortunately, all that was gained on the Kashmir front and on the military front was wasted away after Gen Musharraf wilted under the US pressure in 2003 and decided to take steps to please USA and India. Reining in Kashmir focused Jihadi groups, allowing India to fence the LoC and signing peace treaty with India in January 2004 changed the perspective. It helped Indian military to suppress Kashmir freedom movement. Earlier on, Musharraf had submitted to all the 7 demands of Washington in September 2001. Free hand given to CIA and FBI had enabled the two to establish their network in FATA and gain control over airports and seaport in Pakistan. Intelligence acquisition in FATA was taken over by CIA and ISI pushed on the back seat. \\nIndo-Pak peace treaty in 2004 enabled RAW to ignite FATA, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Baluchistan and Karachi. While RAW assisted by CIA, NDS, MI-6 and Mossad made full use of its long arm to bleed Pakistan with the help of proxies, Pak security forces and ISI remained handicapped. The so-called friends pushed Pakistan to fight terrorism but secretly backed the terrorists. The US kept twisting the arm of Pakistan that if ISI meddled into India or Afghanistan it will be declared a rogue outfit. Perforce, the ISI undertook protective measures only, but its defensive actions were more often breached because the so-called allies stabbed Pakistan in the back. As a consequence, RAW and its strategic partners carried out one-sided covert war while the ISI at best tried to ward off the attacks. In spite of defensive policy of the govt and ISI, and Pakistan suffering much more human casualties than any other country in the war on terror, ISI was blamed to be in collusion with Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Haqqani Network, Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). These were termed as strategic assets of military establishment to overcome conventional inferiority against arch enemy India. The lost intelligence space In FATA/KP was gradually recovered when Lt Gen Shuja Pasha took over as DG ISI and Gen Ashfaq Kayani as COAS in 2008. \\nAll the terror attacks that took place in India between 2001 and 2008 were pinned on JeM and LeT and their connection was made with ISI. Since Pakistan made no effort to disprove Indian contention even after it was revealed by Indian investigative agencies and Home Ministry officials that Hindu terror groups and Indian military intelligence officers were involved in the attacks, it became easier for India to further strengthen its narrative of portraying Pakistan as a terror abetting state and a nursery of terrorism. India\\u2019s narrative was boosted up by its strategic allies. The US dubbed Pakistan as the most dangerous county in the world. Pakistan\\u2019s overall defensive policy and apologetic stance emboldened its detractors to keep whipping and bleeding it without fear of tit for tat response from ISI. \\nOther than the salvos fired by the Indo-Afghan-US-Israel nexus on Pak Army and ISI, Pakistan political leadership of major political parties also view the two premier institutions with distrust. Both PPP and PML-N in line with their 2006 Charter of Democracy made efforts to enfeeble ISI and keep Army under their thumb. First attempt was made by Benazir Bhutto when she replaced Lt Gen Hamid Gul with retired Lt Gen Kallue in 1989 and next tasked Air Marshal Zulfiqar to cut ISI to size under the garb of reforms. PM Yusaf Raza Gilani tried to civilianize ISI in August 2008 by placing it under Ministry of Interior. Kerry Lugar Bill in 2009 and Memo scandal in 2011 were other attempts to curtail military\\u2019s power. Nawaz Sharif has a history of locking horns with every Army chief and has still not got out of the hangover of Gen Musharraf. Although he didn\\u2019t clash with Gen Raheel but at times civil-military relations became tense. \\nIt has now been conclusively established that RAW and NDS in unison and backed by other agencies are deeply involved in proxy war in Pakistan since 2003 and have inflicted tens of thousands of cuts on the body of Pakistan and its people. Series of conspiracies have been hatched and launched to destabilize and fragment Pakistan. RAW-NDS nexus backed by CIA is continuing to use Afghanistan as a launching pad for terror attacks in Pakistan. In order to scuttle CPEC, focus of attacks is on Baluchistan and KP. India is keeping the LoC on fire. So far it has violated 2003 ceasefire agreement 178 times and killed 19 civilians and injured 80. \\nThe anti-Pakistan foreign agencies are making full use of TTP, Jamaat Ahrar, Lashkar Jhangvi, BLA, BRA, BLF and MQM as proxies. London is a safe haven for MQM leadership and Baloch rebel leaders, while Afghanistan has provided sanctuaries to TTP runaway leaders in Kunar, Nuristan and Nangarhar. Besides these strategic assets, the detractors are also making use of NGOs, human rights activists and segment of media to make Pakistan a compliant state of India. Since HN, JeM, and LeT are not playing the game of foreign agencies, they are dubbed as terrorist groups and strategic assets of Pak Army/ISI. They want Pakistan to take strict action against them or else face isolation and sanctions. \\nIt was in the backdrop of this concern of US and India that the Dawn News published a story on October 6. The planted story was allegedly furnished by someone from within the PM House where a national security conference presided by the PM and attended by Foreign Secretary, Punjab Chief Minister, COAS, DG ISI and National Security Adviser was held. The invented story written by Cyril Almeida gave an impression of serious rift between civil and military leadership and that while the govt wanted to proceed against the defunct militant groups, the ISI didn\\u2019t. Probable motive of concocted story was to demean the Army/ISI and to reinforce Indo-US stance that Pak Army and ISI were in league with terror groups. The types of Hussain Haqqani, Ayesha Sadiqa, Farzana Bari and several other liberal journalists assembled in London two days ago to play up this story. MQM (Altaf) hosted them. To ascertain the truth, a high powered committee comprising members from three intelligence agencies will carry out inquest. \\nHaving collected tons of evidence, yet Pakistan takes the barbs and whips without a whimper and doesn\\u2019t pick up courage to strike back. The long arm of ISI remains sheathed for reasons best known to the policy makers. It implies our leaders have decided to give a free hand to our enemies to continue bleeding Pakistan without any fear of retaliation or even protest. Going by the well-established concept that \\u2018offence is the best defence\\u2019, until and unless the ISI pay back the RAW and NDS in the same coin, one sided bleeding of Pakistanis will continue. Long arm must be unsheathed. \\nThe writer is retired Brig, war veteran, defence analyst, columnist, author of 5 books, Vice Chairman Thinkers Forum Pakistan, DG Measac Research Centre, and Member Executive Council PESS.

Mr. Bissonnette also recently forfeited $180, 000 in fees for consulting work that he did for military contractors while he was still on the SEAL team, his lawyer, Robert D. Luskin, said in an interview. If approved by a federal judge in Alexandria, Va. the royalty settlement would bring an end to more than two years of civil and criminal investigations into Mr. Bissonnette, who won several awards for valor in Iraq and Afghanistan before writing \\u201cNo Easy Day,\\u201d his   book on the Bin Laden raid, under the pen name Mark Owen. The firsthand account of the daring raid was one of several   books and movies involving former Navy SEALS that has led to criticism within a community once known for discretion that Mr. Bissonnette and the others were cashing in on their exploits. The Justice Department conducted criminal investigations into whether Mr. Bissonnette had disclosed classified information in his book or speeches and whether he had violated    laws in consulting for companies that had contracts with SEAL Team 6. In the end, the department did not bring any criminal charges, settling instead for the cash forfeitures. Mr. Bissonnette said in a statement Friday that he regretted his failure to submit \\u201cNo Easy Day\\u201d for vetting before it was published in 2012 so Pentagon officials could ensure that it did not include classified information. Mr. Bissonnette acknowledged that he was required under his security clearances to let the Pentagon review the book, and he blamed another lawyer for advising him that he did not need to do so. \\u201cI acknowledge my mistake and have paid a stiff price, both personally and financially, for that error,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI accept responsibility for failing to submit the book for review and apologize sincerely for my oversight. \\u201d Documents filed in Federal District Court in Alexandria on Friday indicated that Mr. Bissonnette must transfer nearly $6. 8 million to the government as part of the settlement. The amount includes all of the $6. 7 million in royalties he has earned on \\u201cNo Easy Day,\\u201d as well as $100, 000 in fees for six speeches he gave in early 2013 before the government approved the slides he used in such presentations. Mr. Bissonnette wrote in \\u201cNo Easy Day\\u201d that he was one of the SEALs who shot Bin Laden, and he and Robert O\\u2019Neill, another former SEAL Team 6 member who claims his shots were the fatal ones, have competed on the lecture circuit. Military officials said that Mr. O\\u2019Neill is writing a book of his own and has asked the Pentagon to vet it. While Mr. Bissonnette\\u2019s fight with the Pentagon over his book has received public attention, some details of his consulting work while he was still a SEAL Team 6 member, as well as his fee forfeiture, have not been disclosed. Mr. Luskin said that Mr. Bissonnette and the federal authorities reached a \\u201cnonprosecution agreement\\u201d in May in which Mr. Bissonnette forfeited $180, 000 in fees for advising three equipment manufacturers who were doing business with SEAL Team 6 while he was on the team. Mr. Luskin said the fees dated back as far as 2006, when Mr. Bissonnette was the research and development representative for his squadron within Team 6. Other former SEAL members have said that his job was to figure out what types of equipment they needed. Mr. Luskin said that the $180, 000 came from   a helmet maker now owned by the Gentex Corporation in Carbondale, Pa. and two   manufacturers based in Virginia Beach  \\u2014   SS Precision and London Bridge Trading. No executives at the three companies were available for comment. Mr. Luskin said that Mr. Bissonnette and other SEAL members also received consulting fees from companies that designed tactical clothing and gear for other parts of the military or for sales to outdoor enthusiasts. Mr. Bissonnette has maintained that he cleared the consulting work in advance with a Navy lawyer, and Mr. Luskin said that helped persuade prosecutors that \\u201cthere was clearly on Matt\\u2019s part no intent to breach the    laws. \\u201d Navy officials say they have restricted such moonlighting since then. Mr. Luskin also noted that a number of   officials have assisted other authors writing about the Bin Laden raid as well as the creators of the movie \\u201cZero Dark Thirty. \\u201d But, he said, only Mr. Bissonnette has paid any penalties for the disclosures.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"0\",\n          \" \\u0447\\u0442\\u043e\\u0431\\u044b \\u044d\\u0442\\u043e \\u0431\\u044b\\u043b\\u0430 \\u0434\\u043e\\u0440\\u043e\\u0433\\u0430 \\u0441 \\u0434\\u0432\\u0443\\u0441\\u0442\\u043e\\u0440\\u043e\\u043d\\u043d\\u0438\\u043c \\u0434\\u0432\\u0438\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435\\u043c.\",\n          \"1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

If the original order were indeed a matter of pressing national security  \\u2014   which the Ninth Circuit doubted  \\u2014   that would reinforce the point.  According to that logic, there might only be two reasons for Trump to persist in appealing the Ninth Circuit ruling to the Supreme Court. One is that the Ninth Circuit ruling is so bad  \\u2014   it makes no reference to the underlying statute, and would give even a   hijacker the right to sue to come to the U. S.  \\u2014   that it deserves to be publicly rejected. However, it is not going to be persuasive to other courts, and would likely be overturned or limited to the facts of this particular case, eventually. The other reason for Trump to go to the Supreme Court is that he has said publicly said he would do so. He would lose some credibility, and perhaps suffer some embarrassment, were he to withdraw. Yet ego alone should not trump national security. But the reality is that Trump actually has no choice: he has to go to the Supreme Court, because the left would likely sue to stop any executive order he issued on the subject. Given the left\\u2019s determination to oppose anything and everything he does  \\u2014   even blocking new Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos from visiting a school on Friday  \\u2014   it is a safe bet that they would simply sue in a Ninth Circuit court again, and Trump would likely be forced to appeal to the Supreme Court in any case. So even if there is an extremely urgent national security threat, Trump might have to wait months, even to improve on the first order. And so it is ugly to say, but is likely true, that the courts may have increased the threat of terror to our country. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

Credit: Jiri Rezac \\nWomen are typically at a disadvantage in nearly every country in the world, but just how much depends on that country\\u2019s culture. For some, it\\u2019s a struggle of equality in a variety of areas and for others it\\u2019s the immense problem of barely being seen as a person, let alone someone with rights. That\\u2019s why many women are facing these issues head on and working to make a huge difference in the world as we know it. \\nThough many people hear about the female activists that made great strides to get their country to where it is today, people often don\\u2019t know about today\\u2019s activists. Read about the amazing women below to find out who is advocating for women and humanity around the world. Asieh Amini: Honor Killings Credit: Norsk Literatturfestival \\nBorn in northern Iran, the region allowed women to own property, work on farms, and wield social power. Amini didn\\u2019t see the true injustices that women in her country faced until she was working as a journalist and heard of young girls being sentenced to death, by being hanged or stoned, if they engaged in sex without being married, even if they had been raped. \\nShe first advocated for a 19-year-old girl named Leyla who had the mental capacity of an 8-year-old and was repeatedly raped by family members throughout her life. She was sentenced to be stoned to death, but Amini took charge of the situation and pressured the presiding judge into releasing Leyla. \\nThese \\u201chonor killings\\u201d take place because the honor held in the family is more important than a woman\\u2019s life, whether she made the choice to have sex or was raped. \\nAmini has dedicated her life to fighting this horrific practice in her nation, despite the dangers she faces in doing so. She uses her literary background and passion to raise awareness and save the lives of women throughout the country. Though she advocates for this in Iran, she works from Norway because the death threats against her became so severe. Rashmi Misra: Education in India Credit: Namu Kini \\nMany children, especially girls, are being left behind as the fastest-growing country in the world has failed to improve their system of education. India has not improved their infrastructure for schools, has a huge shortage of teachers, and most of their students drop out for various reasons. \\nRashmi Misra was first struck by the irony of the educational system when she witnessed 5 young girls playing in a drain pipe by an IIT campus in 1985. While the institute worked to educate young adults, mostly men, these girls had no access to even a primary school education. She opened her home to these young children to help them learn and wound up helping 200,000 underprivileged children, youth, and women in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore thus far. \\nShe provides a rigorous education for children from poor families and her efforts have garnered international recognition. Her schools are now called Vidya Schools and one of their focuses is on empowering young girls and women by providing free education, lessons on entrepreneurial skills, microfinance, and other areas that are invaluable to a woman\\u2019s livelihood and career. Nanfu Wang and Ye Haiyan: Sexual violence in China Credit: China Film Insider \\nThese two women go hand-in-hand as they worked together to expose cases of sexual violence that occurred in China and were swept under the rug because they involved powerful figures. Haiyan is called \\u201cHooligan Sparrow,\\u201d and Wang helped to visually document their work by filming a documentary. \\nAs the government learned of their activist work, they were subjected to harassment, interrogations, and even imprisonment. But their findings forced them to question what was more important: revealing the truth to stop these injustices or protecting themselves by remaining quiet. \\nOne case they worked on together was the reported sexual abuse of 6 elementary school girls by their school principal. Using secret recording devices, such as those in her glasses, Wang filmed an alarming number of undercover security agents on the streets placed there to prevent the activists from continuing on. \\nDespite these obstacles, Wang was able to leave the country with her smuggled footage to created the film Hooligan Sparrow, which exposes the injustices and has become a world-renowned documentary. Safa al Ahmad: Free speech in Saudi Arabia Credit: Janne Louise Andersen \\nThe number of restrictions that women face in Saudi Arabia is shocking, and for Safa al Ahmad these limitations are continuously made possible because the government-controlled media. She has famously said, \\u201cFacts are a special commodity in Saudi Arabia.\\u201d \\nWhen the Arab Spring shook the nation, Al Ahmad illegally filmed the peaceful uprisings that took place in an effort to raise awareness about what was actually occurring in the nation. She had to smuggle the footage out in order to distribute \\u201cSaudi\\u2019s Secret Uprising,\\u201d but her work didn\\u2019t stop there. \\nThe lack of freedom of speech became so bad that teenagers were arrested and sentenced to death from posting on Facebook, and this is one reason that Al Ahmad continues to document the uprisings throughout the Middle East to advocate for freedom of speech and women\\u2019s rights. \\nDespite receiving death threats both online and in-person as she returns to the ground to document the unrest, Safa has no plans of yielding. Liya Kebede: Safe childbirth in Ethiopia Credit: Lemlem \\nEveryday, over 800 women die from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth and another 30 are sent home from the hospital with long-term illnesses and injuries. \\nSupermodel Liya Kebede, who was born and raised in Ethiopia, had knowledge of the unsanitary and unsafe conditions mothers are subjected to when giving birth and decided to take action. She started her foundation, named after herself, after first becoming a WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health. \\nThe foundation focuses on training healthcare professionals, mostly in Africa, to ensure safer births and to provide low-cost technology and community-based education programs. In one of the health centers that the foundation works with, successful hospital deliveries rose by 50% in 12 months . \\nKebede has used her celebrity to further her goals for improving the health of women by writing for The Huffington Post and discussing her foundation when featured in Vogue and The Daily Beast. Brittany Packnett: Racial equality in the US Credit: The Huffington Post \\nThe U.S. has always faced issues in regards to racial equality, and the most recent attacks against the systematic suppression of black people involves police disproportionately shooting and killing unarmed black men. \\nIn the fight for social justice, as instances of these shootings are being made more public through social media, Brittany Packnett has become a leader in the movement of demanding justice for these crimes and in improving impoverished black communities. \\nAccording to the Guardian , \\u201cShe\\u2019s a co-founder of We The Protestors and Campaign Zero, a platform to end police violence. She served on the Ferguson Commission, the President\\u2019s Task Force on 21st Century Policing and builds culturally responsive educators at Teach For America.\\u201d \\nPacknett\\u2019s extensive background in addressing issues that people of color face makes her a force to be reckoned with, and she has even acknowledged that the conversations need to include black women and the LGBTQ community to make the movement for racial equality more effective. Sonita Alizadeh: Child marriage in Afghanistan Credit: The Salt Lake Tribune \\nWhen Sonita Alizadeh was 10 and living in Afghanistan, her parents attempted to sell her off as a bride, but the deal fell through when her family fled the Taliban instead and moved to Iran. Alizadeh has said that she was so young that she didn\\u2019t understand what being married off even entailed. \\nAt the age of 16, her parents attempted to sell her again because they wanted to raise $9,000 for her older brother to buy a bride. By selling Sonita, they figured they could get that money from whomever bought her. She had been self-educating herself and knew that this was not what she wanted, and instead rebelled and refused to move back to Afghanistan, where her parents were living. \\nHer outrage over child marriages manifested itself in a video she filmed of her rapping about the injustice. Titled \\u201cBrides for Sale,\\u201d the song became immensely popular amongst women that faced this issue and attracted the attention of a U.S. nonprofit, who brought Sonita over to the states, where she now lives in Utah and attends school on a full scholarship. \\nShe continues to write songs that are fiercely feminist and address the barriers that women face around the world. A documentary was made about her fight for gender equality, titled Sonita , and has been met with exceptionally good response. \\nSince 57% of Afghanistan\\u2019s girls are married off before they are 19, Sonita\\u2019s work has the potential to inspire women to stand up against child marriages and effect change in their nation. Melina Laboucan-Massimo: Indigenous rights in Canada Credit: Jiri Rezac \\nIn Canada, it\\u2019s suspected that there are over 4,000 missing and murdered indigenous women whose cases were swept under the rug. The nation has long struggled with appropriately working with indigenous people to bring justice to these crimes and end the oppression of aboriginals. \\nMelina Laboucan-Massimo\\u2019s sister was murdered, and when she was met with law enforcement officials who didn\\u2019t care about the case, she took action. Her history of advocating for indigenous rights helped her take her activism to the next level as she fought against this horrible tragedy and her nation\\u2019s inappropriate way of dealing with it. \\nNow she works as an advocate for the environmental and the cultural revitalization of indigenous people as well as an advocate for these missing and murdered indigenous women. Fortunately, Prime Minister Trudeau has now taken office after conservative Stephen Harper and has made this issue a priority to help aboriginal people going forward. \\nLaboucan-Massimo\\u2019s work is far from over, but it\\u2019s always great when the country an activist is working in gains an ally that is high up and ready to help. Mary Beard: Internet harassment Credit: BBC \\nChildren, young adults, and women experience bullying and abuse on social media everyday and, since the Internet is such an open and lucrative space, it\\u2019s difficult to stop it. Girls and women are faced with harassment more often because of sexist views that exist in every country, and that\\u2019s what Mary Beard is trying to put an end to. \\nThe scholar of classical literature is one of the many women who knows what it\\u2019s like to be attacked online for her beliefs but is one of the few people who confronts the perpetrators. She says that the content of the messages is a \\u201cpredictable menu of rape, bombing, murder, and so forth.\\u201d \\nWhile most sit back and ignore or block the people sending hateful messages, she broadcasts the messages to shame the people so that they don\\u2019t go unpunished. She also responds to them by trying to enlighten them and is surprisingly effective in her efforts. \\nDubbed \\u201cThe Troll Slayer\\u201d by The New Yorker, the profile hails her online activism as courageous, hilarious, and ingenious. Her troll slaying is making social media a safer place for women as she continues to combat and convert trolls into never trolling other women again. Esther Ibanga: Women-led peaceful protests Credit: Niwano Peace Foundation \\nNigeria has been a place of perpetual periods of peace and conflict for several years because of the diverse ethnicities and religious groups that exist within the nation. \\nEsther Ibanga recognized this destructive pattern of tentative peace and war and realized that empowered women could stop this madness. As a Nigerian pastor, she has already defied social norms and was no stranger to feminist values and beliefs. \\nShe started the Women Without Walls Initiative , which brings together women from a variety of backgrounds and trains them to make peace between their groups. By educating women and building conflict-resolution, mediation, and dialogues between warring parties, her goal is for ethno-religious violence to become a thing of the past and to create peace in the country. \\nHer efforts also focus on developing poor communities, aiding displaced persons, and empowering the youth. She has also continuously advocated for the \\u201cBring Back Our Girls\\u201d campaign, which is listed in more detail below. Obiageli Ezekwesili: #BringBackOurGirls Credit: All Africa News Desk \\nThe \\u201cBring Back Our Girls\\u201d campaign demands that the 230 girls that are still missing after being stolen by Boko Haram terrorists be returned to their families. The girls are suspected of being forced into marriages, rape, and conscription as suicide bombers. \\nThough a handful of girls were able to escape in the beginning, most of the 270+ girls taken in the mass abduction have not been recovered since they went missing in 2014. Obiageli Ezekwesili quickly mobilized the activists that followed her through grassroots efforts to bring attention to the issue, and the campaign garnered international attention. \\nEzekwesili still works to bring the remaining girls home, and continues her work against corruption and social injustice. Her work within the government and as co-founder of Transparency International has helped to bring an end to corruption. Berta Caceres: Environmental activism Credit: Goldman Environmental Prize \\nBeing an activist in any country is inherently dangerous, as that means going up against people of power with endless money and resources to keep activists quiet. In 2015, 185 environmental activists were murdered around the world for their opposition to destructive practices by industrial corporations, meaning their work is dangerous but necessary. \\nBerta Caceres was one of the people murdered in Honduras, as she used her voice to oppose the construction of a damn on indigenous land. Similar to what\\u2019s happening with protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline in the U.S. right now, indigenous people opposed construction because it was unlawful and unnecessary. \\nCaceres\\u2019 tireless work led her to be shot and killed in her own home. She ousted people with power for their involvement in the coup that led to the fall of democratic Honduras, including Hillary Clinton , and was killed for her efforts in exposing this injustice. \\nThe activists\\u2019 death has sparked more outrage towards the government and against destructive practices as they try to combat climate change. \\nWhat are your thoughts on these activists\\u2019 work?

If the original order were indeed a matter of pressing national security  \\u2014   which the Ninth Circuit doubted  \\u2014   that would reinforce the point.  According to that logic, there might only be two reasons for Trump to persist in appealing the Ninth Circuit ruling to the Supreme Court. One is that the Ninth Circuit ruling is so bad  \\u2014   it makes no reference to the underlying statute, and would give even a   hijacker the right to sue to come to the U. S.  \\u2014   that it deserves to be publicly rejected. However, it is not going to be persuasive to other courts, and would likely be overturned or limited to the facts of this particular case, eventually. The other reason for Trump to go to the Supreme Court is that he has said publicly said he would do so. He would lose some credibility, and perhaps suffer some embarrassment, were he to withdraw. Yet ego alone should not trump national security. But the reality is that Trump actually has no choice: he has to go to the Supreme Court, because the left would likely sue to stop any executive order he issued on the subject. Given the left\\u2019s determination to oppose anything and everything he does  \\u2014   even blocking new Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos from visiting a school on Friday  \\u2014   it is a safe bet that they would simply sue in a Ninth Circuit court again, and Trump would likely be forced to appeal to the Supreme Court in any case. So even if there is an extremely urgent national security threat, Trump might have to wait months, even to improve on the first order. And so it is ugly to say, but is likely true, that the courts may have increased the threat of terror to our country. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

Credit: Jiri Rezac \\nWomen are typically at a disadvantage in nearly every country in the world, but just how much depends on that country\\u2019s culture. For some, it\\u2019s a struggle of equality in a variety of areas and for others it\\u2019s the immense problem of barely being seen as a person, let alone someone with rights. That\\u2019s why many women are facing these issues head on and working to make a huge difference in the world as we know it. \\nThough many people hear about the female activists that made great strides to get their country to where it is today, people often don\\u2019t know about today\\u2019s activists. Read about the amazing women below to find out who is advocating for women and humanity around the world. Asieh Amini: Honor Killings Credit: Norsk Literatturfestival \\nBorn in northern Iran, the region allowed women to own property, work on farms, and wield social power. Amini didn\\u2019t see the true injustices that women in her country faced until she was working as a journalist and heard of young girls being sentenced to death, by being hanged or stoned, if they engaged in sex without being married, even if they had been raped. \\nShe first advocated for a 19-year-old girl named Leyla who had the mental capacity of an 8-year-old and was repeatedly raped by family members throughout her life. She was sentenced to be stoned to death, but Amini took charge of the situation and pressured the presiding judge into releasing Leyla. \\nThese \\u201chonor killings\\u201d take place because the honor held in the family is more important than a woman\\u2019s life, whether she made the choice to have sex or was raped. \\nAmini has dedicated her life to fighting this horrific practice in her nation, despite the dangers she faces in doing so. She uses her literary background and passion to raise awareness and save the lives of women throughout the country. Though she advocates for this in Iran, she works from Norway because the death threats against her became so severe. Rashmi Misra: Education in India Credit: Namu Kini \\nMany children, especially girls, are being left behind as the fastest-growing country in the world has failed to improve their system of education. India has not improved their infrastructure for schools, has a huge shortage of teachers, and most of their students drop out for various reasons. \\nRashmi Misra was first struck by the irony of the educational system when she witnessed 5 young girls playing in a drain pipe by an IIT campus in 1985. While the institute worked to educate young adults, mostly men, these girls had no access to even a primary school education. She opened her home to these young children to help them learn and wound up helping 200,000 underprivileged children, youth, and women in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore thus far. \\nShe provides a rigorous education for children from poor families and her efforts have garnered international recognition. Her schools are now called Vidya Schools and one of their focuses is on empowering young girls and women by providing free education, lessons on entrepreneurial skills, microfinance, and other areas that are invaluable to a woman\\u2019s livelihood and career. Nanfu Wang and Ye Haiyan: Sexual violence in China Credit: China Film Insider \\nThese two women go hand-in-hand as they worked together to expose cases of sexual violence that occurred in China and were swept under the rug because they involved powerful figures. Haiyan is called \\u201cHooligan Sparrow,\\u201d and Wang helped to visually document their work by filming a documentary. \\nAs the government learned of their activist work, they were subjected to harassment, interrogations, and even imprisonment. But their findings forced them to question what was more important: revealing the truth to stop these injustices or protecting themselves by remaining quiet. \\nOne case they worked on together was the reported sexual abuse of 6 elementary school girls by their school principal. Using secret recording devices, such as those in her glasses, Wang filmed an alarming number of undercover security agents on the streets placed there to prevent the activists from continuing on. \\nDespite these obstacles, Wang was able to leave the country with her smuggled footage to created the film Hooligan Sparrow, which exposes the injustices and has become a world-renowned documentary. Safa al Ahmad: Free speech in Saudi Arabia Credit: Janne Louise Andersen \\nThe number of restrictions that women face in Saudi Arabia is shocking, and for Safa al Ahmad these limitations are continuously made possible because the government-controlled media. She has famously said, \\u201cFacts are a special commodity in Saudi Arabia.\\u201d \\nWhen the Arab Spring shook the nation, Al Ahmad illegally filmed the peaceful uprisings that took place in an effort to raise awareness about what was actually occurring in the nation. She had to smuggle the footage out in order to distribute \\u201cSaudi\\u2019s Secret Uprising,\\u201d but her work didn\\u2019t stop there. \\nThe lack of freedom of speech became so bad that teenagers were arrested and sentenced to death from posting on Facebook, and this is one reason that Al Ahmad continues to document the uprisings throughout the Middle East to advocate for freedom of speech and women\\u2019s rights. \\nDespite receiving death threats both online and in-person as she returns to the ground to document the unrest, Safa has no plans of yielding. Liya Kebede: Safe childbirth in Ethiopia Credit: Lemlem \\nEveryday, over 800 women die from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth and another 30 are sent home from the hospital with long-term illnesses and injuries. \\nSupermodel Liya Kebede, who was born and raised in Ethiopia, had knowledge of the unsanitary and unsafe conditions mothers are subjected to when giving birth and decided to take action. She started her foundation, named after herself, after first becoming a WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health. \\nThe foundation focuses on training healthcare professionals, mostly in Africa, to ensure safer births and to provide low-cost technology and community-based education programs. In one of the health centers that the foundation works with, successful hospital deliveries rose by 50% in 12 months . \\nKebede has used her celebrity to further her goals for improving the health of women by writing for The Huffington Post and discussing her foundation when featured in Vogue and The Daily Beast. Brittany Packnett: Racial equality in the US Credit: The Huffington Post \\nThe U.S. has always faced issues in regards to racial equality, and the most recent attacks against the systematic suppression of black people involves police disproportionately shooting and killing unarmed black men. \\nIn the fight for social justice, as instances of these shootings are being made more public through social media, Brittany Packnett has become a leader in the movement of demanding justice for these crimes and in improving impoverished black communities. \\nAccording to the Guardian , \\u201cShe\\u2019s a co-founder of We The Protestors and Campaign Zero, a platform to end police violence. She served on the Ferguson Commission, the President\\u2019s Task Force on 21st Century Policing and builds culturally responsive educators at Teach For America.\\u201d \\nPacknett\\u2019s extensive background in addressing issues that people of color face makes her a force to be reckoned with, and she has even acknowledged that the conversations need to include black women and the LGBTQ community to make the movement for racial equality more effective. Sonita Alizadeh: Child marriage in Afghanistan Credit: The Salt Lake Tribune \\nWhen Sonita Alizadeh was 10 and living in Afghanistan, her parents attempted to sell her off as a bride, but the deal fell through when her family fled the Taliban instead and moved to Iran. Alizadeh has said that she was so young that she didn\\u2019t understand what being married off even entailed. \\nAt the age of 16, her parents attempted to sell her again because they wanted to raise $9,000 for her older brother to buy a bride. By selling Sonita, they figured they could get that money from whomever bought her. She had been self-educating herself and knew that this was not what she wanted, and instead rebelled and refused to move back to Afghanistan, where her parents were living. \\nHer outrage over child marriages manifested itself in a video she filmed of her rapping about the injustice. Titled \\u201cBrides for Sale,\\u201d the song became immensely popular amongst women that faced this issue and attracted the attention of a U.S. nonprofit, who brought Sonita over to the states, where she now lives in Utah and attends school on a full scholarship. \\nShe continues to write songs that are fiercely feminist and address the barriers that women face around the world. A documentary was made about her fight for gender equality, titled Sonita , and has been met with exceptionally good response. \\nSince 57% of Afghanistan\\u2019s girls are married off before they are 19, Sonita\\u2019s work has the potential to inspire women to stand up against child marriages and effect change in their nation. Melina Laboucan-Massimo: Indigenous rights in Canada Credit: Jiri Rezac \\nIn Canada, it\\u2019s suspected that there are over 4,000 missing and murdered indigenous women whose cases were swept under the rug. The nation has long struggled with appropriately working with indigenous people to bring justice to these crimes and end the oppression of aboriginals. \\nMelina Laboucan-Massimo\\u2019s sister was murdered, and when she was met with law enforcement officials who didn\\u2019t care about the case, she took action. Her history of advocating for indigenous rights helped her take her activism to the next level as she fought against this horrible tragedy and her nation\\u2019s inappropriate way of dealing with it. \\nNow she works as an advocate for the environmental and the cultural revitalization of indigenous people as well as an advocate for these missing and murdered indigenous women. Fortunately, Prime Minister Trudeau has now taken office after conservative Stephen Harper and has made this issue a priority to help aboriginal people going forward. \\nLaboucan-Massimo\\u2019s work is far from over, but it\\u2019s always great when the country an activist is working in gains an ally that is high up and ready to help. Mary Beard: Internet harassment Credit: BBC \\nChildren, young adults, and women experience bullying and abuse on social media everyday and, since the Internet is such an open and lucrative space, it\\u2019s difficult to stop it. Girls and women are faced with harassment more often because of sexist views that exist in every country, and that\\u2019s what Mary Beard is trying to put an end to. \\nThe scholar of classical literature is one of the many women who knows what it\\u2019s like to be attacked online for her beliefs but is one of the few people who confronts the perpetrators. She says that the content of the messages is a \\u201cpredictable menu of rape, bombing, murder, and so forth.\\u201d \\nWhile most sit back and ignore or block the people sending hateful messages, she broadcasts the messages to shame the people so that they don\\u2019t go unpunished. She also responds to them by trying to enlighten them and is surprisingly effective in her efforts. \\nDubbed \\u201cThe Troll Slayer\\u201d by The New Yorker, the profile hails her online activism as courageous, hilarious, and ingenious. Her troll slaying is making social media a safer place for women as she continues to combat and convert trolls into never trolling other women again. Esther Ibanga: Women-led peaceful protests Credit: Niwano Peace Foundation \\nNigeria has been a place of perpetual periods of peace and conflict for several years because of the diverse ethnicities and religious groups that exist within the nation. \\nEsther Ibanga recognized this destructive pattern of tentative peace and war and realized that empowered women could stop this madness. As a Nigerian pastor, she has already defied social norms and was no stranger to feminist values and beliefs. \\nShe started the Women Without Walls Initiative , which brings together women from a variety of backgrounds and trains them to make peace between their groups. By educating women and building conflict-resolution, mediation, and dialogues between warring parties, her goal is for ethno-religious violence to become a thing of the past and to create peace in the country. \\nHer efforts also focus on developing poor communities, aiding displaced persons, and empowering the youth. She has also continuously advocated for the \\u201cBring Back Our Girls\\u201d campaign, which is listed in more detail below. Obiageli Ezekwesili: #BringBackOurGirls Credit: All Africa News Desk \\nThe \\u201cBring Back Our Girls\\u201d campaign demands that the 230 girls that are still missing after being stolen by Boko Haram terrorists be returned to their families. The girls are suspected of being forced into marriages, rape, and conscription as suicide bombers. \\nThough a handful of girls were able to escape in the beginning, most of the 270+ girls taken in the mass abduction have not been recovered since they went missing in 2014. Obiageli Ezekwesili quickly mobilized the activists that followed her through grassroots efforts to bring attention to the issue, and the campaign garnered international attention. \\nEzekwesili still works to bring the remaining girls home, and continues her work against corruption and social injustice. Her work within the government and as co-founder of Transparency International has helped to bring an end to corruption. Berta Caceres: Environmental activism Credit: Goldman Environmental Prize \\nBeing an activist in any country is inherently dangerous, as that means going up against people of power with endless money and resources to keep activists quiet. In 2015, 185 environmental activists were murdered around the world for their opposition to destructive practices by industrial corporations, meaning their work is dangerous but necessary. \\nBerta Caceres was one of the people murdered in Honduras, as she used her voice to oppose the construction of a damn on indigenous land. Similar to what\\u2019s happening with protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline in the U.S. right now, indigenous people opposed construction because it was unlawful and unnecessary. \\nCaceres\\u2019 tireless work led her to be shot and killed in her own home. She ousted people with power for their involvement in the coup that led to the fall of democratic Honduras, including Hillary Clinton , and was killed for her efforts in exposing this injustice. \\nThe activists\\u2019 death has sparked more outrage towards the government and against destructive practices as they try to combat climate change. \\nWhat are your thoughts on these activists\\u2019 work?
